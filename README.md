# Overview <br />

The toolbox includes all the code I wrote for the area of machine learning <br />

#Software requirement: <br />

Python mainly, c++ probably in the future <br />

#What is in it? <br />

(1) Classification:
	* Logistic Regression: a solver for inferring parameters in LR with different approaches (SGD/GD/SVRG)
(2) Clustering:
	* K-mean: implement naive k-mean algorithm in Python
	* SOM: self-organized map in MATLAB, implemented using tensor operation
(3) Dimensionality Reduction:
	* PCA
(4) Neural Network:
	* TFNN : a Python class for setting up neural network in tensorflow
	* MLP_SingleOutput: matlab class for multi-layer perceptron
(5) Model Selection:
	* GA: genetic algorithm written in Python, following sklearn coding style.
